Project Name: Study Café

Application Description:
Study Café is a cozy, cafe-themed web app that blends productivity and relaxation. It is inspired by the aesthetics of lofi playlists and the focus of study tools like Quizlet and Notion. This app creates a virtual space where users can study with flashcards, play ambient music, use a Pomodoro timer, and track their progress.
