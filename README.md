**Application Description:**  <br/>
Study Café is a cozy, cafe-themed web app that blends productivity and relaxation. It is inspired by the aesthetics of lofi playlists and the focus of study tools like Quizlet and Notion. This app creates a virtual space where users can study with flashcards, play ambient music, use a Pomodoro timer, and track their progress. The app is ideal for students who enjoy visual organization and want an all-in-one space for active recall, reflection, and focusing while they work.  

**Features & Tools:**  <br/>
Customizable cafe themes (day, rainy, plant nook): HTML, CSS, React, CSS animations <br/>
Embedded lofi music player: Spotify, Radio API  <br/>
Flashcard system with shuffle & tracking: React, backend (Node.js & MongoDB)  <br/>
